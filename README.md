# README
Hello! Welcome to my readme for Stripe Payments Intent integration :)

# Built With
* Backend built with [Express](http://expressjs.com))
* Frontend built with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev).

## Before You Get Started
Before you get started lets make sure you can start the services you need. Please open your Terminal and check if you have NPM installed with the following command:

```npm -v```

If you dont have NPM head over to [NPM JS](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to install it on your computer.

## Starting The Services
To make it easier and more consistent I've included all the libraries you'll need to run. Please open two tabs or windows to start the Backend and Client.

1. Navigate to folder where you have this code.
2. To start the backend:
```npm start```
3. Change directories into the `frontend_client` directory and start the frontend client:
```npm start```
4. At this point a browser should have opened with the payment screen, if not open your web browser and enter this into the url:
```localhost:3000```
